    <h3>Chanel is a private company and world leader in creating, manufacturing and distributing luxury products, including Ready-to-Wear, Accessories, Fragrances, Makeup, Skincare, Jewellery and Watches</h3>
    <h3>Elegance, simplicity, monochrome colours, and well-fitting clothes are what made her, and her brand stand out. That is also summed up in one of Coco Chanel's popular fashion quotes “fashion changes, but style endures.”</h3>

    <h3>Chanel's uncluttered styles, with their boxy lines and shortened skirts, allowed women to leave their corsets behind and freed them for the practical activities made necessary by the war. Elements of these early designs became hallmarks of the Chanel look </h3>
